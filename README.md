# code39decoder
If you need to decode a barcode 39 in an image... it is a good beginning.
I begun this is a project with my company http://www.derhy.com  (Ren√© Derhy) 
The intend was to grab code 39 barcodes out of a picture.
I didn't quite finished the project and there is room for a lot of improvement.
The detection in itself work.
Please let me know if you use it.
Maybe I'll translate the french comments in the code.
