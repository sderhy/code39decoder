# code39decoder
If you need to decode a barcode 39 in an image... it is a good beginning.
I begun this is a project within my company http://www.derhy.com  (Ren√© Derhy) 
The intend was to grab code-39 barcodes out of a picture, for logistics purpose.
I didn't quite finished the project and there is room for a lot of improvements.
The detection in itself work but in only one direction.
Please let me know if you use it.
Maybe I'll translate the french comments within the code, if somebody request it or
would star this project...
